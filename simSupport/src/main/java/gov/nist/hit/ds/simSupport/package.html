Simulator definition and runtime support library.

<p>First a few definitions:

<p><em>Simulator (big Picture)</em> - An implementation of a IHE Actor (or similar) that starts it operation by receiving a transaction (input message). 
The term simulator differentiates it from an implementation in two ways.  First, socially, in IHE implementations are what vendors build, bring to Connectathon
to test and sell as products while simulators are testing artifacts.  Second, a simulator does not necessarily implement every requirement of an Actor.  It 
implements enough to be useful as a testing tool.  Also, simulators are likely to be out-fitted with logging capability that can give
feedback to developers testing against them.

<p><em>Simulator (Java class)</em> - in memory representation of a simulator. It is linked to the SimDb by the SimId it carries.  Actually, a Simulator class
instance carries references to multiple simulators.  This allows for the construction of composite simulators - simulators that are composed of smaller, simpler 
simulators that somehow cooperate.  An example is the Repository/Registry simulator.  It is a composite as a convenence to implementers of Document Source
and Document Consumer actors. They can create a single simulator and get a complete test environment.

<p><em>SimulatorConfig<em> - an instance of SimulatorConfig represents a single Simulator (not a composite). It contains linkages to state (the SimId) and
the pre-defined endpoints, option settings etc. 

<p><em>SimulatorConfigElement</em> - a single configuration item inside a SimulatorConfig. A configuration item might be an endpoint definition. 

<p><em>SimId</em> - a string used to identify a particular instance of a simulator.  There can be, for example, 3 instances of a Document Registry simulator
running concurrently.  They are identified by their SimId.

<p><em>EventLog</em> - within the logs maintained for a simulator, one section is set aside to store the request and resulting response messages that pass
through the simulator instance. EventLog is a class used to maintain the input/outputs of a single transaction interaction.

<p><em>Event</em> - a single transaction instance usually composed of a request message followed by a response message.

<p><em>SimDb</em> - short for Simulator Database. An area set aside to maintain status, logs and state of all running simulators.  

<p>There are a collection of conversions that are possible when dealing with the internals of a simulator.  The following are possible:

<p>SimDb, SimId ==> Simulator

<p>EventLog ==> Simulator

<p>Simulator ==> SimId

<p>SimId ==> SimDb instance
