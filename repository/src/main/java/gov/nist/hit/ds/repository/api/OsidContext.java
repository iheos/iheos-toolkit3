/**
 * <p>
 * OsidContext holds contextual information that is shared by the application
 * and the OSID implementations it uses. The osid package has some design
 * constraints that create the need for OsidContext.  They are:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * OSIDs must work with all frameworks.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * OSID implementations are independent of each other.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * These design constraints mean that there this no obvious place to put global
 * information.  The OsidContext argument of the OsidLoader.getManager method
 * is intended to provide access to information that is global to an
 * application and the OSID implementations that it loads.  OsidContext can
 * hold and retrieve context. The only requirement is that the information is
 * serializable. There are OsidContext methods to get and assign context.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * With few exceptions OSID objects are interfaces and not classes. The use of
 * interfaces in the definition of OSID objects has some important
 * characteristics:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * There is no OSID framework for storing contextual (global) information.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * The OSID implementation developer can define OSID objects by implementing
 * the OSID interface and extending a framework class.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Contextual (global) information can only be communicated when the
 * application loads an implementation.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * These characteristics of OSIDs and the need to provide sharable contextual
 * (global) information led to the definition of OsidContext. An application
 * is responsible for supplying a valid OsidContext instance when it loads an
 * OSID implementation using the OsidLoader.getManager method. This approach
 * provides all the benefits and limitations of any system of global data.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * OsidContext uses an unambiguous String as a key to assign the serializable
 * context information. To retrieve the contextual information from the
 * OsidContext the getContext method is called with the key.
