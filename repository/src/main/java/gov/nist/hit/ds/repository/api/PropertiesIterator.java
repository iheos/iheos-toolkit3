/**
 * PropertiesIterator provides access to these objects sequentially, one at a
 * time.  The purpose of all Iterators is to to offer a way for OSID methods
 * to return multiple values of a common type and not use an array.  Returning
 * an array may not be appropriate if the number of values returned is large
 * or is fetched remotely.  Iterators do not allow access to values by index,
 * rather you must access values in sequence. Similarly, there is no way to go
 * backwards through the sequence unless you place the values in a data
 * structure, such as an array, that allows for access by index.
