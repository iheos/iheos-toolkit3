/**
 * The Type class captures the fundamental concept of categorizing an object.
 * Type are designed to be shared among various OSIDs and Managers.  The exact
 * meaning of a particular type is left to the developers who use a given Type
 * subclass.  The form of the Type class enables categorization. There are
 * four Strings that make up the Type class: authority, domain, keyword, and
 * description.  The first three of these Strings are used by the isEqual
 * method to determine if two instance of the Type class are equal.  The
 * fourth String, description, is used to clarify the semantic meaning of the
 * instance.
 * 
 * <p>
 * An example of a FunctionType instance:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <br/>  - authority is "higher ed"<br/
 * >  - domain is "authorization"<br/
 * >  - keyword is "writing checks"<br/
 * >  - description is "This is the FunctionType for writing checks"
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This Type could be used with the authorization OSID.  It could also be used
 * with the dictionary OSID to determine the text to display for a given
 * locale (for example, CANADA_FRENCH).  The dictionary OSID could use the
 * FunctionType instance as a key to find the display text, but it could also
 * use just the keyword string from the FunctionType as a key.  By using the
 * keyword the same display text could then be used for other FunctionTypes
 * such as: <br/
 * >  - authority is "mit"<br/
 * >  - domain is "accounting"<br/
 * >  - keyword is "writing checks"<br/
 * >  - description is "A/P check writing type"<br/
 * >An instance of the Type class can be used in a variety of ways to
 * categorize information either as a complete object or as one of its parts
 * (ie authority, domain, keyword).
