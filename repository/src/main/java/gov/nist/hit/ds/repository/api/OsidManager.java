/**
 * OsidManager is the key to binding an application to an OSID implementation.
 * An OSID is required to define an interface that extends OsidManager.  The
 * OSID implementation is required to have a class that implements its
 * OsidManager. The application loads an OSID implementation by using the
 * OsidLoader to get an instance of the OSID's OsidManager.  The application
 * accesses all OSID objects directly or indirectly through the OSID's
 * OsidManager.
 * 
 * <p>
 * OsidManager defines three methods: getOsidContext, assignOsidContext,
 * assignConfiguration. The assign methods are called by the
 * OsidLoader.getManager method. An application can use the assign methods,
 * but this would only be for overriding the default behavior of the
 * OsidLoader.getManager method.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The OsidLoader.getManager method checks its OsidContext argument to make
 * sure it is not null, and then calls the Osidmanager implementation class
 * assignOsidContext method.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The OsidLoader.getManager method loads a properties file that contains the
 * configuration information if one exists. The configuration information is
 * set by the system integrator who has installed an implementation. The
 * configuration properties file is loaded by by the OsidLoader.getManager
 * method using the getResourceAsStream method of the OSID's OsidManager class
 * to search for the configuration properties file. The properties from the
 * loaded configuration file are overlaid with any configuration properties
 * supplied by the application in the call to the OsidLoader.getManager call
 * in the additionalConfiguration argument. The assignConfiguration method is
 * then called.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Typically, the application calls the getOsidContext method only.  It is
 * unusual for the application to override the OsidLoader.getManager and call
 * assignOsidContext or assignConfiguration.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The implementation of OsidManager can use both the OsidContext and the
 * Configuration properties as needed.
