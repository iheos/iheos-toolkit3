Potential improvements :

We need to pass around a validation context, containing a lot more information :
- both Opensaml and XmlSlurper representation of the message. (to switch information context)
- other information coming from other layers : for example we need the addressing info from the soap envelope

We need to be able to conditions tests on other.
-> We might need Validation as first level object rather than just annotated methods.

Actually this problem runs deeper: specifications can themselves branch the validations in different way.
We might need a information model that allows to trace each requirement accross different spec.

We need to improve the reporting. What do we log? How?

We need to improve the way we qualify our validations so we can quickly extend to new behaviors

Some tests can induce fatal error, some do not.

We might want to prioritize, review the order in which the tests are performed. 

We must be able to check code lists
