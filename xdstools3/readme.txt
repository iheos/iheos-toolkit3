Prerequisites to import the project under a code editor (tested under Eclipse):

You need to have the following plugins installed:

- GWT plugin
- Maven plugin

Your Maven installation has to be configured to use NIST Nexus server. For that you need
 to edit your settings.txt file under [your-maven-install]/conf/ to add the information
located under the "servers" tag. 
  
  An example of a settings file is available here:

Import the project in your editor as a Maven project.
