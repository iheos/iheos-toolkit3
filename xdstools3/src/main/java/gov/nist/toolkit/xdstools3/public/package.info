This package was created to hold the application stylesheet. It must stay in the same directory than the GWT module file
in order to be found at compile time.

Here is an example of the necessary layout:
- com.google.gwt.sample.stockwatcher
  + client
  + server
  + shared
  - public
      |- StockWatcher.css
  - StockWatcher.gwt.xml

When you run the app, the css file will be copied to the /war/stockwatcher directory with the other generated files.
