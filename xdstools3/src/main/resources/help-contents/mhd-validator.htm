<ul>
    <li>Select the message type &ndash; Submit is the only supported type, for now.</li>
    <li>Use the Browse button to browse your local file system to identify a bundle to be validated. This is the body of a HTTP Post that would be sent to an endpoint. Do not include the HTTP headers. This tool is not prepared to handle them.</li>
    <li>Hit the Run button.</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>VALIDATION PROCESS</strong></span></p>

<ul>
    <li>If the input is in JSON format, it is translated to XML. This is done using HL7 FHIR tooling.</li>
    <li>The XML is validated against the HL7 FHIR XML Schema. The bundle model is validated. This looks for what is included in the bundle, how elements are cross-linked, etc. The individual DocumentManifest and DocumentReference object are validated.</li>
    <li>When the validation completes, a summary is displayed at the bottom of the window. Each major section, listed above, is presented as a link which when opened displays further detail.</li>
</ul>
