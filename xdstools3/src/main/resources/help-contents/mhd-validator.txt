Use the Browse button to browse your local file system to identify a bundle to be validated.  This is the body of a HTTP Post that would be sent to an endpoint.  Do not include the HTTP headers. This tool is not prepared to handle them.

Hit the Run button.

The following validations will be performed:

If the input is in JSON format it is translated to XML.  This is done using HL7 FHIR tooling.

The XML is validated against the HL7 FHIR XML Schema.

The bundle model is validated.  This looks for what is included in the bundle, how elements are cross linked, etc.

The individual DocumentManifest and DocumentReference object are validated.

When the validation completes a summary is displayed at the bottom of the window.  Each major section, listed above, is presented as a link which when opened displays further detail.
