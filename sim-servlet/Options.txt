Simulator options

Basic simulator URL is
    http://host:port/xdstools3/sim/simid/actor/transaction

This form is expected in the To header of the SOAP Addressing block.

Another form is acceptable as the target URL

    http://host:port/xdstools3/sim/simid/option1/option2/...

where each option is an independent flag controlling the operation
of the simulator.  Most options are defined by a specific
transaction but some are appropriate for any simulator. An option
specified that is not recognized is ignored and there is no
overlap between option names and actor/transaction names.

Options appropriate for any simulator

fault - force a SOAP fault to be returned
